As in its name, this app is designed to help volleyball enthusiasts and professionals, such as coaches, players, officials etc with sport-related activities, both during and 
off-match. 

This document is design to provide programming-savvy users with general architectural overview and specific references.

First, let me tell that the following is the fifth architectural design used in the development of this app. The first one was a complete mess, the second one was a structured mess, 
the third one was a relatively good construction based on said structured mess, the fourth one was some weird futuristic concept that was decided to try due to the pause in the 
development of the third one (hello, quarantine), and the current fifth one is another form of the third one but written from scratch due to said pause.
As you can see, I'm happy to finally write this.

Now, a few words about what's what and how it works.

There are several important cornstone-concepts of the code's architecture:

* OBJECTS, including
    * EVENTS
    * VISUAL ELEMENTS 
    * REQUESTS
    * LOGS

* SCREENS

* DATA CONFIG, including
    *APP CONFIG
    *MATCH CONFIG
    *LOCALIZATION
    *PROTOCOL IMAGE BORDERS
    *INTERVAL INSTRUCTIONS

* CORE FUNCTIONS 

Basically, these are all the cornstones...

Before we start, let's go through the directory structure. 

Anyway, let's inspect them in detail, shall we? The following is the description of each category, what it is, what it does, why so etc. For an actual reference list, look below.

Let's start with the simpliest now.
